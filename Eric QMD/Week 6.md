The authors of this article delve into the theory and techniques of tuning the Hyper parameters utilized by the SVM in relation classification, specifically Random Search. Often times this tuning requires a significant time investment with trial and error. It can also require specific knowledge of the data and outcomes associated with the training of the model, and frequently different variables will yield greater results dependent on the outcome. They concluded that given low dimensionality data sets Random Search can yield similar predictive results as more complex tuning methods such as grid search and meta-heuris tics.

The paper delves into the Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel of SVM's and discusses the need for hyper parameter selection between a regularization and a governing parameter. The paper goes on to detail that there is no generally accepted means for the optimization of hyper parameters. Once approach is to continuously re-sample the initial training data from the data set utilizing different methods and then evaluate them. Ultimately the paper concludes that based on the research and testing of 17 varying methods of 121 data sets there is no definite solution to determine a one size fits all approach to selection of parameters based on an expected outcome.
