This article details the ways in which Support Vector Machines have been utilized to perform time series analysis. I found this very interesting as in my current line of work we are looking for ways to implement more Machine Learning into our models and we do a fair amount of Time Series Analysis. This is a important topic for us as we start to work through the best way we can utilize and implement our model and how to best identify the uses for the model. Additionally this article delves into SVR and how that methodology can also be utilized in Time Series modeling.

The above article delves into the comparative difference between a few different methodologies relative to Machine Learning, such as KNN, SVM, and LSTM. The article further details the strengths and weaknesses of each and their most practical use cases based on what the implementer is ultimately seeking to achieve. Ultimately this provides more context on how to best utilize our model and to most effectively choose our groups data set so that when we start building our project we are not starting off on the wrong foot.
