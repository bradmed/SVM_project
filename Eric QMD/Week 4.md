The article above details out the various ways we can quickly train SVM models utilizing Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithms to reduce the problems that can arise from large scale programming. A parallel SMO method was the primary focus of this paper as it covered the basic functions and algorithms behind the inner workings as applied to an SVM.

This article walks through how to successfully setup and run an SVM based on a binary classification problem. Furthermore, it details the inner workings of various types of kernels that can be used to accurately map your planes based on the complexity of the data. I found this particularly interesting as I was wondering about what kernel to build upon and it seems as if an RBF or a Gaussian kernel might be our ticket.
