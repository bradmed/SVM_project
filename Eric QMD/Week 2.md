The above article from the Journal of statistical Software outlines what Support Vector Machines are and what their use cases can be. The article continues by leveraging the mathematical equations for classification and regression as well as deployment strategies for data sets in R. The article concludes with examples of code and outputs showcasing the results on the iris data set.

The above speaks to controlling the sensitivity of Support Vector Machines to reduce the number of False Positives/Negatives in the output. Veropoulos, Campbell, and Cristianini go on to detail the difference between Sensitivity and Specificity through various mathematical approaches and analyses. Their research with medical data sets where Box constraints were not statistically significant between the 4 data sets. However, the strain on the algorithm was insignificant and could aid in over all determinations.
