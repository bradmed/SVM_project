In Dibiki et al's paper on Support vector machines he discussed what SVM's are and what that the underlying statistical methods are. The paper overall was heavily math based and at times over my head. However it did have information about how and why support vector machines are built. Predominately the author notes that reseacher Vapnik constructed SVM's based off of Structural Risk Minimaization(SRM) as opposed to Empirical Risk minimization and that SRM proved to be better at creating more generalizable models.

The author goes on to explain that the hyperplane is a the maximal margin between data points in a data set. This is called the "Optimal Separating Hyperplane" The authors then went through the math of how to solve for the problems and examples of how to chose kernel functions to ensure that a hyperplane can be found. 

The examples the author used was were the classification if image data to determine classification of land cover (water, forest, roads, etc) Another example was comparing the performance of an Artificial Neural Network to Support Vector machines to predict stream flow data based on daily rainfall and evaporation based on 3 different locations. The general finding was that SVM and ANN's can both be readily leveraged to build similar models and predictions
