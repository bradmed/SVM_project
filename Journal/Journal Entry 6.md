Mortality prediction based on imbalanced high-dimensional ICU big data takes a look at predicting mortality based on a large number of data dimensions with various amounts of data missing. Over all this paper appears to follow an approach that would be good for our project using the MIMIC data set.

Most of the article goes beyond the scope of Support Vector Machines but delves into principal component analysis to determine what to use to build the support vector machines.The author leverages Cost Sensitive Principal Component Analysis to preprocess the data to deal with missing data and feature extraction. Once this preprocessing step has completed, the authors build a support vector machine to predict mortality. The also build a number of other support vector machines using Chaos particle swarm optimization for parameter optimization and derivatives of CPSO to determine the best model based on the ROC AUC value. In the end the found the SVM using data that had been processed with their modified Cost Sensitive Principal Component Analysis  and SPSO 

Through their findings the authors also opine about the large amount of data and the necessity of determining which are the key features to from which to build a model such as a SVM. They state that the overall number of data points will continue to increase as sensors and technology are continually introduced and improved upon in medical settings and that while the data is great and represents a virtual gold mine, it is important to ensure that data is clean and useful for prediction and not just noisy data for algorithms to churn through
